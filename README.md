# SpacegrayEighties.vim

Vim Theme matching the Eighties version of [Spacegray](https://github.com/kkga/spacegray) for Sublime.

## Screenshots

Look how almost correct it is!


## Installation

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend installing
[pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and then simply copy and
paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle && git clone git://github.com/hhff/SpacegrayEighties.vim.git

This was generated with the [Coloration](https://github.com/sickill/coloration) Gem from the [Spacegray Eighties](https://github.com/kkga/spacegray) Textmate theme.

I also like the [Spacegray Eighties iTerm](https://github.com/mhkeller/spacegray-eighties-iterm.git) theme too.  What can I say, I'm a spacey  guy!!! 

¯\_(ツ)_/¯
